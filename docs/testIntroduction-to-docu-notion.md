docu-notion lets you use [Notion](https://notion.so) as your editor for markdown-based static site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Using Notion instead of raw markdown files means that you don't have to teach non-developers how to make git commits and pull requests. It also allows you to leverage Notion's database tools to control workflow, Notion's commenting feature to discuss changes, etc.


:::tip

Note that docu-notion is not a service that could be reading your data. docu-notion is just open-source code that will run on your computer or your CI system.

:::info

In Notion, notice that the `slug` of this page is a slash. This tells [Docusaurus ](https://docusaurus.io/)that this is the default document to show.
